<div id="bio"><p>Hello and Welcome!</p>
    <p>My name is Jennifer, and I'm rapidly becoming obsessed with coding.  As a long-time fan of the internet in general, my journey of discovery into the inner workings of the web has been quite the adveture, with new surprises and adventures around every corner.  I recently finished the Skillcrush Web Developer Blueprint, and am just beginning their Freelance WordPress Developer Blueprint, which I hope to translate into learning to build some fantastic sites for fantastic people and organizations!  I'm also working through the materials at Free Code Camp, in order to review my basic HTML/CSS and Javascript skills, as well as hopefully progress to some of the more advanced skills.  I am really passionate about self-guided learning, and I hope to be able to accomplish great things with my new-found tech powers!!</p>
